      "Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. \"Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,\" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. \"The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,\" said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. \"That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,\" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. \"This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \"one of the options\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\" Mr Dein said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\"\n",

       "array([b'[START] arsenal \\' may seek full share listing \\' arsenal vice - chairman david dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the london stock exchange . speaking at the soccerex football business forum in dubai , he said a full listing was \" one of the options \" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium . the club - which is currently listed on the smaller ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60 , 000 - seater emirates stadium at ashburton grove for the start of the 2006 / 07 season . mr dein also warned the current level of tv coverage of the premiership may be reaching saturation level , with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season . when arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52 % this season to 34 % in two years \\' time . the club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29 % to 40 % of turnover , and has not ruled out other money - earning means , including a full share listing . \" when the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review , \" mr dein said . \" listing would be one option , but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet . \" we want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it ( listing ) , manchester united have been a success . \" mr dein said that , although television money and coverage had driven the english game forward in the past 10 years , he feared there might now be too many games being shown . since the formation of the premier league in season 1992 / 93 , premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar . \" television has been the driving force over the past 10 years . . . but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world \\' s leading league competition . \" we must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline , and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on tv too . \" i think we have practically reached saturation point . . . sometimes i think less is more . \" the club is funding its move to ashburton grove through a number of sources , including debt from banks , from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors , and from the sale of surplus property , including its highbury stadium . it is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets , including asia . \" we have two executives travelling round japan and china at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs , and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too , as they are around the world . \" we have got a very good product , so it is very important we go and look at these markets , and make sure we are on the case . \" [END]',\n",

       "'Dollar gains on Greenspan speech\\n\\nThe dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the Federal Reserve head said the US trade deficit is set to stabilise.\\n\\nAnd Alan Greenspan highlighted the US government\\'s willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. In late trading in New York, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on Thursday. Market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. On Friday, Federal Reserve chairman Mr Greenspan\\'s speech in London ahead of the meeting of G7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected US jobs data. \"I think the chairman\\'s taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he\\'s taken for some time,\" said Robert Sinche, head of currency strategy at Bank of America in New York. \"He\\'s taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.\"\\n\\nWorries about the deficit concerns about China do, however, remain. China\\'s currency remains pegged to the dollar and the US currency\\'s sharp falls in recent months have therefore made Chinese export prices highly competitive. But calls for a shift in Beijing\\'s policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major Chinese newspaper that the \"time is ripe\" for a loosening of the peg. The G7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in Chinese policy. In the meantime, the US Federal Reserve\\'s decision on 2 February to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with European rates. The half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep US assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. The recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the US\\'s yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of US bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. The White House will announce its budget on Monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.\\n'"
